                <p>Here is a quick guide to get started. Are you ready?</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        First things first, I'll try to create a default config.json file for you. It contains some
                        placeholder configurations that you can use to customize your log files.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        To do so, please head to the <a href='<?= buildUrl('configurations') ?>'>Configuration</a> page, and set up your configurations
                        according to your needs.
                    </li>
                    <li>
