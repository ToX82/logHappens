                        <strong>LogHappens can't read apache's error.log!</strong>
                        <div>
                            <p>By default, Apache log files are not readable by Apache itself, which is a good
                            security measure for production servers. However, on a development machine, you
                            might want to grant the necessary permissions to make those files accessible to
                            LogHappens. <br>Here's what you can do:</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>Edit the file /etc/logrotate.d/apache2 and locate the line that says
                                <code>create 640 root adm</code>.<br>
                                Replace it with <code>create 777 root adm</code>.</li>
                                <li>Grant 777 permissions to the Apache logs directory by running the command:<br>
                                <code>sudo chmod -R 777 /var/log/apache2/</code></li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>
                    </li>
                    <li class="mb-3">
                        <strong>LogHappens can't read my application's log files!</strong>
                        <div>
                            <p>
                                No worries! Just make sure the log file has the appropriate permissions for
                                LogHappens to read and write (truncate) it. Set the file's permissions to 777,
                                and LogHappens will be able to do its magic.

                            <p>
                                This means that the file is read only and cannot be truncated. To fix this
                                issue, simply change the file's permissions to 777.

                                This means that the file path is incorrect. To fix this issue, simply change
                                the file's path to the correct one.
