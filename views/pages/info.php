                <h5>Bug happens... <span class="iconify" data-icon="emojione-v1:pile-of-poo" data-inline="true" data-width="40"></span></h5>
                <p>
                    Every developer knows that. The frustrating part is that when you want to figure out what went
                    wrong, you often find yourself sifting through hundreds of lines of log files, written in a
                    format that seems to defy human comprehension.
                </p>

                <h5>That's why LogHappens exists!</h5>
                <p>
                    LogHappens is here to solve this very problem. It's a simple tool that won't prevent
                    you from writing bugs, but it will promptly notify you whenever something gets logged
                    by your web server or your favorite framework.
                </p>

                <h5>Does it handle different log formats?</h5>
                <p>
                    Of course it does. Every software has its own bugs, and every software has its own
                    unique way of logging events. That's why we've made LogHappens as user-friendly as possible,
                    allowing you to easily create your own log file reading routine. We've even included a few
                    "standard" log parsers that you can use right away.
                </p>

                <h5>How do I start tracking my logs?</h5>
                <p>
                    To start tracking your logs, you'll need to configure a few things. 
                    You can do this by going to the <a href="<?= buildUrl("configurations") ?>">Configurations</a> page
                    and adding your first configuration.
                    You can customize some settings as well, like the UI theme, in the <a href="<?= buildUrl("settings") ?>">Settings</a> page.
                </p>

                <h5>Any troubles?</h5>
                <p>
                    If you run into any issues, please refer to our <a href="<?= buildUrl("display/start") ?>">Start</a>
                    or <a href="<?= buildUrl("display/troubleshooting") ?>">Troubleshooting</a> page.
                    And if you happen to come across any technical problems, don't hesitate to open an issue on
